# Project Plan: Full-Stack Hour Tracker

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a web-based application designed to be a comprehensive hour-tracking and project management system. It will allow users to manage projects, track time spent by various team members, and handle high-level planning. The system will be built with a decoupled architecture, where a single backend API serves data to a modern frontend, allowing for potential future integrations with other applications.

---

## 2. Core Features

The application will be built around the following key functionalities:

### User Management
* **Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and securely manage their accounts.
* **Authorization:** Implement roles for different user types (e.g., Administrator, Manager, Team Member) to control access to various parts of the system.

### Project Management
* **CRUD Operations:** Users can create, view, update, and delete projects.
* **Project Details:** Each project will include a name, description, assigned team members, a project lead, and a status (e.g., "Active," "On Hold," "Completed").

### Time Tracking
* **Time Entry:** Users can log hours against specific projects. Each entry should include the date, hours spent, a description of the work, and the associated project.
* **Reporting:** A reporting dashboard will show total hours logged per project, per user, and within specific date ranges.

### People & Team Management
* **Team Assignment:** Managers can assign team members to projects and track their progress.
* **Team Member Profiles:** View profiles for each team member, including their active projects and a summary of their logged hours.

### Planning & Dashboard
* **Visual Calendar/Timeline:** A planning view, possibly a calendar or timeline, will provide a high-level overview of project timelines and team member assignments.
* **Home Dashboard:** A personalized dashboard for each user showing their current projects, tasks, and recent activity.

## 3. Technical Stack

The application will use a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack.

* **Frontend:** **React**
    * A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
    * **Recommendation:** Use a framework like **Next.js** on top of React for enhanced performance and developer experience with features like Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
* **Backend:** **Nest.js**
    * A progressive Node.js framework for building a scalable and maintainable backend API.
    * Uses **TypeScript** for strong typing and better code organization.
    * Will handle all API endpoints for the frontend.
* **Database:** A relational database like **PostgreSQL** or a NoSQL database like **MongoDB** will be used for data persistence. The choice will be made based on specific data modeling needs (e.g., relational data is a good fit for projects and time entries).
* **Containerization:** **Docker** will be used to containerize the application for consistent development and deployment environments.

## 4. Monorepo and Deployment Strategy

The project will be managed within a single repository, known as a **monorepo**. This approach simplifies dependency management and ensures a unified development workflow.

### Monorepo Structure

The project directory will be organized as follows:

```
/project-root
├── /backend/                # All Nest.js code
│   ├── /src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── tsconfig.json
├── /frontend/               # All React code
│   ├── /src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── tsconfig.json
├── Dockerfile               # Single Docker file to build both apps
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

### Docker Deployment

A single `Dockerfile` will be used for the entire application. This file will use a multi-stage build process to:
1.  Build the production assets for the React frontend.
2.  Build the production-ready Nest.js backend.
3.  Copy the compiled assets from both stages into a single, lightweight final image.
4.  The Nest.js server will be configured to serve the static React frontend assets from a designated folder, making the entire application accessible from a single port.
